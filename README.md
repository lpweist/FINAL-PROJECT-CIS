CIS024C Final Project 
Lauren Weist

This is a code that calculates the current location that the International Space Station is over the Earth. It prompts a user if they would like to know the location of the ISS, calculates the location for the current date and time, reports the latitude and longitude to the GUI (and to the command line for easy copying), and generates a .html file containing this location plotted on a map of the world. 

To run this code first initialize all the packages and libraries using poetry. This can be done by first running 'poetry install' on the command line in a python command shell. Thiss will install all the necessary dependencies. 

Once this is done, the code is ready to run! Simply type 'python main.py' in the command line, and interact with the GUI as you desire (either selecting 'yes' or 'no.'). Enjoy learning the current location of the international space station!
